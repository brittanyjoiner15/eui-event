## Happy Hacktoberfest!!

_I remember my first Hacktoberfest so clearly because I was so intimidated by Git and contributing code to other repos, and I was still VERY early in my coding journey and didn't even know how to code, but enjoyed the experience so much!_

_Hacktoberfest holds a special place in my heart because it's a great way to get started into coding and comfortable with Github. I'm so excited to finally mantain a repo that I can help others experience the same joy I did!_

# React + Eui Template for An Event Website

This is a template for an event based website. It started as a website I created for an event my ERG is hosting ([Rainbow Stack Summit](https://www.rainbowstacksummit.com/)), but I decided to make it it's own repo so others can contribute to it and use as well!

This is all very much WIP, so if you have any comments or ideas, or want to contribute, feel free to create an issue.

## Demo

View a live demo of the site hosted on Vercel!
